# Classification-Algorithms
This repository will be dedicated to Classification based problems, with a ReadMe document providing empirical and statistical backing to the codes in Python

I am using Call Quality Data from TRAI, the only problem here is that I do not have a lot of continuous data period therefore the analysis can be doubtful. Here is the Overview
Dataset Detail

  â€¢ There are 2 open datasets made available by Indian
  Government related to Voice Call Quality and Internet
  Speed
  1. Data Source 1:https://data.gov.in/catalog/voice-call-quality-customer-experience?page=1 This catalog provides Customers Feedback
  Captured using TRAI MyCAll App. Customers rates their
  experience about voice call quality in real time and help TRAI
  gather customer experience data along with Network data.

  2. Data Source 2: [MySpeed (Crowdsourced Mobile Data Speeds):](https://data.gov.in/catalog/myspeed-crowdsourced-mobile-data-speeds) This catalog provides 	Crowdsourced Mobile Data Speeds and other network information measured using TRAI MySpeed App.

I am using Basic Bar Plots for multiple columns for both datasets. And for Classification Algorithm LR, KNN, DTC

Will be using Random Forest for the next part
